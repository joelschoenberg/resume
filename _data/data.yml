  title: Career Summary
  summary: |
    Beginning with developing code for the Atari 400 and IBM/XT in the 1980s
    I have always been interested in the inner workings of computing. In the
    1990s after being a contractor on a few gigs, I helped launch Windows 95
    as a second level support engineer. That led to a long career in implementing 
    software and selling platform technologies to many large companies. After 
    mastering Microsoft technologies I moved into working with linux-based and 
    cloud-based platforms. This led to application development and observability,
    which I evolved into product development at Splunk, eventually leading to 
    patents created and realizing products that helped customers solve problems 
    around the world.

    time: 2018 - Present
    company: Splunk
    details: |
      I began as a Sales Engineer covering the same patch as my previous customers.
      After successful implementations that led to multi-million dollar contracts, 
      I was brought into a team integrating Splunk with new aquisitions including
      SignalFX and Rigor. We patented three technologies that led directly to 
      features that customers implemented for great value. I was then tagged to
      work on the architect team that brought observability features to the 
      sales team in a useful way by creating demos, content and solutions.
