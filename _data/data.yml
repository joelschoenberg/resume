career-profile:
  title: Career Summary
  summary: |
    Beginning with developing code for the Atari 400 and IBM/XT in the 1980s
    I have always been interested in the inner workings of computing. In the
    1990s after being a contractor on a few gigs, I helped launch Windows 95
    as a second level support engineer. That led to a long career in implementing 
    software and selling platform technologies to many large companies. After 
    moving through Microsoft and mastering their technologies I moved into 
    working with linux-based and cloud-based platforms. This led to application 
    development and observability, which I evolved into product development at 
    Splunk, eventually leading to patents created and realizing products that 
    helped customers solve problems around the world.

    time: 2018 - Present (8 years)
    company: Splunk
    details: |
      I began as a Sales Engineer covering the same patch as my previous customers.
      After successful implementations that led to multi-million dollar contracts, 
      I was brought into a team integrating Splunk with new aquisitions including
      SignalFX and Rigor. We patented three technologies that led directly to 
      features that customers implemented for great value. I was then tagged to
      work on the architect team that brought observability features to the 
      sales team in a useful way by creating demos, content and solutions. With 
      the introduction of the Splunk MCP server, I focused on agentic workflows.
      Customers include: Tableau, Starbucks
  - role: Sales Engineer
    time: 2017 - 2018
    company: Appdynamics
    details: |
      Worked with customers to instrument their code to prove the value of 
      observability and then complete sales of hosted and on-premises software.
      Showed value to .NET and Java customers on both performance and business 
      metrics, leading to multi-million dollar purchases. Customers had both
      exiting solutions and custom built instrumentation that was replaced
      with Appdynamics. Some customers include: Boeing, Alaska Airlines.

      As a Sales Engineer I was responsible for proving value out of an enterprise
      version of an open-source technology. Many customers implemented configuration
      management using similar technology and as the SE I proved the value of moving to
      an enterprise solution that worked across both windows and *nix variants.
      Customers include: Nike, Microsoft, Costco
  - role: Marketing Manager, Product Manager, Sales Engineer
    time: 2004 - 2015
    company: Microsoft
    details: |
      I began with selling the Windows client platform to customers as an enterprise 
      version, proving value in an upgrade from customers that bought new devices. 
      In that role, I was elevated as the voice of the customers across the globe and
      influenced how the Windows platform evolved, including delivering a demo on-stage 
      at a Windows launch event with Bill Gates. I moved into product management for the
      management platform following acquisitions of technologies. Then I rounded out this
      phase of my career as the owner of Windows technologies at the Microsoft retail store,
      including defining the global OS image as well as defining in-store experiences.
